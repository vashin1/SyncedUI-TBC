1) Remove your Interface + WTF folder from your TBC folder  
2) Use provided Interface folder  
3) Follow the ElvUI setup 
4) Launch game and log into your main character and take some time to setup your video, sound and Interface settings. 
5) Open the ElvUI configuration by typing /elvUI or hitting escape  
6) Browse to "Profiles"  
7) Select import a profile and copy and paste the string I've included in the Synced-UI-TBC-Profile.txt document  
8) /reloadUI  

At this point you need to configure Recount and Omen and place them where you choose. I personally use the right panel as my docking point. The addons are themed by default to match the UI

Enjoy!
